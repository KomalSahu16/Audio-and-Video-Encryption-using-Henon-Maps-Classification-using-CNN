Multimedia Encryption and Detection using Chaotic Maps & CNN 
•	Designed a chaotic encryption system for video and audio using the Henon map, ensuring computational efficiency and high sensitivity to initial conditions.
•	Implemented encryption & decryption pipelines with quality evaluation metrics (MSE, PSNR, SSIM, Entropy, Histogram Correlation) to validate fidelity and robustness.
•	Developed a CNN-based model to automatically classify encrypted vs. original frames, achieving 100% validation accuracy on test data.
•	Conducted comprehensive video/audio analysis with visualization and metric comparisons to demonstrate security effectiveness.
•	Technologies used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, ffmpeg, soundfile
